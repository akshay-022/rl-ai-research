Ideas for what the LLM should do : 
1. Rank idea taste.
2. Rank idea feasibility. 
3. Estimate idea timelines. 
4. Do literature review. 
5. Create a banger summary of the literature surrounding this space, and what sounds most promising. 
6. Doing ablations.
7. Implementing an eval. 



One of the places models are weakest are instruction following and recursive actions taking.
They don't take the right tools actions the right way. Find a taskl ike that it probably will fail. 
Like Sasha's one._task.
